/*
 *  The user's tablespace definition file can be use to override
 *  the default tablespaces that a table will be created in.
 *
 *  The tablespace a table is created in is determined by using the
 *  tablespace macro as it's defined in the tablespace definition files
 *  using the following order of precedence:
 *
 *      1 - usrtbldef.h
 *      2 - vartbldef.h
 *      3 - <prod>tbldef.h
 *
 *  To use the database user's default tablespace for all tables:
 *
 *      #define USE_DEFAULT_TABLESPACE
 *
 *  To remap a tablespace macro to a different tablespace name:
 *
 *      #ifndef MCS_TBS_DEFS
 *      #define MCS_TBS_DEFS
 *      #define MCS_DATA_TBS_01   MCS_D_01
 *      #define MCS_INDEX_TBS_01  MCS_X_01
 *      #endif
